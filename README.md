**Description:**
This project, created for a Database class by two individuals, focuses on Property Appraisal Management with a hierarchical structure.

**Project Overview:**
E-Properties, the management system, handles a portfolio of properties via its team of appraisers. Each appraiser is uniquely identified with personal information, including a code, name, surname, gender, age, and address.

**Property Details:**
Properties are similarly cataloged with distinct identifiers, encompassing information like address, floor, size (in square meters), construction year, and classification as offices or residences. Offices are associated with the owner's VAT number, while residences are linked to the owner's identification number. Furthermore, residences are categorized by specific codes and names (e.g., "apartment," "townhouse," etc.).

**Appraisal Records:**
Appraisers perform property estimations and record the results, including a unique code, price, and the date (day, month, year) of the assessment. Appraisers also interact with an online system for various functions, and their connection details, such as time, date, and duration, are meticulously logged.

**Geographical Hierarchy:**
Each property is situated within an area, which is defined by a unique code, a name, the local population, and the average income. These areas are organized hierarchically, allowing for the mapping of regions to subregions (e.g., "Marousi" is linked to "Attica," and "Attica" is part of the "Central Greece Region").
